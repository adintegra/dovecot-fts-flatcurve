# Thank Yous

Thanks to:

- **Joan Moreau**;
  [fts-xapian](https://github.com/grosjo/fts-xapian) was the inspiration to
  use Xapian as the FTS library, although fts-flatcurve is not based or
  derived from that code
- **Aki Tuomi** and **Jeff Sipek**; conversations with them directly
  convinced me to pursue this project
- **Marco Bettini**, who did the heavy lifting necessary to merge this code into
  Dovecot core; most backported fixes from 2.4 is due to his work.
- **Timo Sirainen** for helping Marco with code review and cleaning up rough
  edges in the design.
